    genres at the time Country and Blues, fused together with the bass playing of R&B, the
    vocals and piano of Soul, and the drum playing of Jazz.

    which featured a rebellious freedom in contrast to the pop music at the time.<br/>

          <br>Near the end of the British Invasion in the mid-to-late 60s the US entered the Vietnam War.
          During which a group of protesters called hippies emerged, influenced by drugs such as LSD.
          To capture this new audience a new, more experimental version of rock was created called Psychedelic Rock.
          Many bands of the British Invasion like The Beatles, and Stones changed their sound for this music.
          Two forms of Psychedelic Rock were formed, bands like The Doors, and Pink Floyd stayed true to
          Rocks roots with a more trippy twist, while bands like Cream and The Jimi Hendrix Experience played louder

            <h4>Heavy Metal<h4/>
              <br>In 1968 to 1969 rock bands abandoned their pychadelic flairs, and cranked their amps to 11
              for music that was more lean and punching. This accompanyed by the afformentioned Cream
              while new commers Led Zepplin, Deep Purple, and Black Sabbath were formed in England. In late 1969 Sabbath begun the recording
              for their self-titled debut album (which was realeased in the following year). The music was louder and the lyrics were darker
              focussing on themes such as drug use (Sweet Leaf), the occult (Black Sabbath), and political corruption (War Pigs).
              Meanwhile, Deep Purple (who started as a pychadelic band) formed a new line up that was more cleaner than sabbath. Meanwhile, in America
              Ronnie James Dio formed his band called Elf, and then moved to Rainbow (which was founded by Purples guitarist Richie Blackmore)
              and a new band that was also from brimingham called Judas Priest was founded that influence wearing obcene amounts of leather to metal
