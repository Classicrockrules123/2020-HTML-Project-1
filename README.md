Origins
Rock began in the late 1940's where the electric guitar playing from the most popular
genres at the time Country and Blues, fused togeth with the bass playing of R&B, the 
vocals and piano of Soul, and the drum playing of Jazz.
Pioneering rock artists such as Elvis and Chuck Berry leaned on blues structure
which featured a rebellious freedom in contrast to the pop music at the time.
